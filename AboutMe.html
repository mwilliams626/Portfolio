    <p>Arduino is a program that is used to convert C++ commands into physical actions from electrical pulses on a breadboard.  Arduino allowed me to code a blinking LED.  I was able to assign which pin recieved the code.  I was also able to make my robot perform certain moods with the Arduino Program, which you see in the video above.  I created a loop to make sure that the robot wouldn't stop the movements after it ran the entire code.</p>
